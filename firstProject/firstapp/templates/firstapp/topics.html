      <h3 class="blogs-card__heading">Till Templates</h3>
      <p class="blogs-card__content">I learnt that you can have multiple templates, apps for every thing, For example, the route that you are on, example.com/topics/. Here topics is an app that has been included in views.py file in the main project and then, if I have to make dyanamic route for example let's say I have a learn more button that redirects to <code>https://example.com/topics/jinja</code> then jinja has to be dynamic template. Although I haven't learnt it yet but I'm sure there has to be a way to dynamic routing. </p>
